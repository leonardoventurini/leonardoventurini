## About Me

I am a Software Engineer passionate about technology and entrepreneurship. I program for about a decade, and I see myself as a generalist who enjoys learning about most varied subjects.

- I have a Bachelor degree in Business Administration ([UNIGRAN](https://www.unigran.br/), Brazil)
- My favorite programming languages are **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**
- I love web-related tech, and most of my work involves full stack development
- I have experience with real-time commerce, enterprise and event management applications

My favorite books are [Coders at Work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coders_at_work), [The Wheel of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time) and [The Tower and the Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Square_and_the_Tower).
